          Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one
          small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western
          India.

        </ul>

        <p>
          The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age,
          genetics and hormones. Young lions have light spotting on their coats
          that disappears as they grow. Without their coats, lion and tiger
          bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.
